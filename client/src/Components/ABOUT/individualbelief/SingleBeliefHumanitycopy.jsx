But sin crept in through temptation by Satan, the Devil. Now humanityâ€™s perfection is tarnished, our bodies and minds corrupted. Our once-idyllic world continues to be in a constant struggle between good and evil.Fortunately, God had a plan to redeem humanity through His Son, Jesus Christ. He will ultimately have victory over sin and death and restore us and our earth to its original state of beauty and perfection.The following statements describe what the Seventh-day Adventist Church believes about the earth and humanity in the context of Godâ€™s ultimate plan."/>
